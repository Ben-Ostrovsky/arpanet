                The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), the
                forerunner of the Internet, was a pioneering long-haul network
                funded by the U.S. Department of Defenseâ€™s Advanced Research
                Projects Agency (ARPA). It served as the test bed for many areas
                of internetworking technology development and testing, and acted
                as the central backbone during the development of the Internet.
                The ARPANET was built using packet-switching computers
                interconnected by leased lines.
